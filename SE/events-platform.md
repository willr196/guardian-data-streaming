# Events Platform

## Context (real or imagined business situation)

A small community business has reached out to you to create a platform where they can create and share events with members of the community. A member of the community can add the event they signed up for to their personal calendar. Some of these events are offered for free, however others are paid for either with a set amount or a pay as you feel charge.  

## Assumptions and prerequisites 

1. You will be using a freely available API to bring in product data for the platform you will be creating. You may need to come up with some data yourself, such as the events and their timings, but this is not the focus of the project. The API you will use is for you to research and decide on prior to starting the project.
2. You will need to sign up for services, such as Google Calendar API, on a free, developer account.

## High-level desired outcome

A platform where a business can share their events with members of the community, and community members can sign up and optionally pay to participate in the events. This can be a website or a mobile app, or both depending on the time you have available. 

## Minimum viable product

A mobile app or a website which allows:

1. creating events by staff.
2. signing up to events by non-staff.
3. being able to add events to a Google calendar, if one has signed up for it.

Consider how you will accomplish the differentiation between staff and users. You will likely need a way to log in as either staff or a user, in which case you _must_ provide both a test staff account and a test user account for us to review your work, as well as for further hiring partners. Please include this in your README. Failing to do so may result in us being unable to review your work.

## Non functional requirements 

- Built in JavaScript or TypeScript. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into account.
- Considerations taken for the security of users log in and payment information.
- Hosted on a free distribution platform.
- The code should include clear and detailed documentation, which includes details on where the project is hosted and explicit steps on how it can be ran locally.

## Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate errors to users, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how an event can be created or signed up for. 

## Non-binding tech suggestions

- Free API to give your events platform a theme (plants, books, films, animals, running, coffees, etc.)
- React or React Native
- TypeScript
- Google API
- Stripe, Google pay, or another payments portal with a free tier

## Possible extensions

- payment platform integration
- sending out confirmation emails when booked in for an event
- social media integration
- both a website and a mobile app
- logging in using a Google account, or other social media

## Due date and completion considerations

The due date is to be advised, but not later than four weeks from commencement. Please note that the following are non negotiable for the fulfillment of the project:  
- you must host a project which covers the MVP;
- you must provide clear documentation summarising the project and explaining how the project can be ran locally;
- you must provide test staff and user accounts for us to review your work.

Omitting these requirements can result in this project being unsuccessful.

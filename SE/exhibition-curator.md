# Exhibition Curator

## Context (real or imagined business situation)

You have always dreamt of being a curator of antiquities and fine artworks, and now you have been approached by a coalition of museums and universities, who want to create viewer driven virtual exhibitions from their combined catalogues. This will be of great use to researchers, students, and art lovers alike. 

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

1. You will use at least two separate Museum or University free APIs to request information about their collections. It is for you to research which APIs you will use in advance of starting this project.
2. You may need to sign up for additional services, please ensure you are using free, developer tiers of any services you sign up for. 

## High-level desired outcome

- Users of the platform can view artworks from the APIs you have decided upon. 
- Users can search all of the APIs you are working with using a search functionality.
- Users can select artowrks to add to a personal collection.
- Each artwork can be viewed separately, where further details for it can be seen - including any images and information associated with curated the artwork.
- Users can navigate between different artworks, and should be provided with links where they can find out more information, and where they can see the artwork in person. 

## Minimum viable product

A website or a web progressive app (WAP) where:

1. A user can provide some search criteria to filter and sort artworks. If no search criteria are provided, the user can see a list of artworks filtered or sorted in a way that is up to you.
2. Images and core information about the artwork are displayed when a user interacts with a thumbnail or other indicator of an artwork from the exhibition.
3. Artworks can be browsed one by one using "Previous" / "Next" type of functionality, or from a list.
4. The artworks can then be saved into a temporary collection, which can be viewed and expanded.
5. Artworks in the 

## Non functional requirement

- Built using JavaScript or TypeScript. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into consideration.
- Fast loading of high quality media content, or indication of loading times to the user. 
- Hosted on a free distribution platform.
- The code should include clear and detailed documentation, which includes details on where the project is hosted and explicit steps on how it can be ran locally.
- For mobile applications, you can host the app on ExpoDev, whch will generate a QR code and a URL so that your project can be accessed via the ExpoDev app.
- For both mobile and web project, consider recording a video of you navigating through the app, sharing it on a free distribution platform and including a link in your README. This can be especially beneficial for a project. 

## Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate to users errors, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how to create a curated exhibition and how to view it.  

## Non-binding tech suggestions

- React 
- React Native
- TypeScript

4. Possible extensions

- permanence of exhibitions through a user profile and a non-relational BE to save favourite search combinations. Consider how users can log in, and the safety of their details, and make sure to share a whitelisted test account for us to review your work
- unique shareable links 
- both a website and a mobile app
- social media integration
- multiple search and filter criteria 

## Due date and completion considerations

The due date is to be advised, but not later than four weeks from commencement. Please note that the following are non negotiable for the fulfillment of the project:  
- you must host a project which covers the MVP;
- you must provide clear documentation summarising the project and explaining how the project can be ran locally;
- if you have log in functionality, you must provide a whitelisted test user accounts for us to review your work. You must include these in the README as well for hiring partners and potential employers to be able to access.

Omitting these requirements can result in this project being unsuccessful.
